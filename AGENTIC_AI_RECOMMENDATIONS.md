```typescript
// Backward compatible - no changes needed
const result = await generateCode(prompt, existingFiles);

// Advanced usage with context management
const agent = new AdvancedGeminiAgent(apiKey);
agent.updateContext({
  projectGoals: ["Build scalable web app"],
  constraints: ["Mobile-first design"],
  preferences: { framework: "React", testing: "Jest" }
});
const result = await agent.generateCode(prompt, existingFiles);
```

### Integrating MCP Servers
```typescript
const agent = new MCPIntegratedAgent(apiKey);
agent.registerMCPServer({
  name: "custom-tool",
  command: ["node", "my-tool-server.js"],
