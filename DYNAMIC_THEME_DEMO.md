## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### 1. **Automatic Application Type Detection**
The agent analyzes user prompts to identify application types:
```
"fitness tracker" ‚Üí Health/Fitness ‚Üí Green/Blue theme
"online store" ‚Üí E-commerce ‚Üí Orange/Purple theme  
"task manager" ‚Üí Productivity ‚Üí Blue/Indigo theme
"social platform" ‚Üí Social Platform ‚Üí Pink/Purple theme
```

### 2. **CSS Custom Properties Integration**
Themes are implemented using CSS custom properties for dynamic switching:
```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #4CAF50;    /* App-specific primary */
  --secondary-color: #2196F3;  /* App-specific secondary */
  --accent-color: #81C784;     /* App-specific accent */
}
```

### 3. **Theme Application Areas**
Colors are automatically applied to:
- **Header**: Background and navigation elements
- **Sidebar**: Active states and highlights  
- **Buttons**: Primary actions and interactions
- **Progress Bars**: Status indicators and completion
- **Navigation**: Active states and hover effects
- **Forms**: Focus states and validation feedback
